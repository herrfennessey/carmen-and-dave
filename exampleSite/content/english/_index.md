  title: "Our Story"
  description: "A Romanian and an American walk into a bar..."
  content: "Carmen and Dave were actually set up on a blind date by a mutual friend, Emma, whom she knew from when she 
  lived in Berlin. Carmen had invited Emma
  to a weekend brunch to catch up, as it had been a while since they had seen each other. Emma had made the excuse 
  that she had already made plans to hang out with Dave that day, and asked if he could he come as well.<br><br>Dave, on the 
  other hand, got plenty of warning, and was fully briefed on what Emma was planning on doing. He even invited the best 
  winglady he knew to hype him up in stories, his sister Shelley and had plenty of time to be nervous leading up to the date. 
  There was only one more problem - Carmen thought Dave and Shelley were married because Shelley was wearing her wedding band.
  <br><br>Thankfully though, after a bit of explanation, the ruse worked, and while Carmen is still annoyed that she 
  was set up on a brunch she had scheduled herself, she and Dave live happily together in Berlin with their two pets, Luna and Mario"

  title: "The Wedding"
  content: "The wedding will be held at Conacul Secuiesc located in rural Transylvania. The venue is in the shadow of the Piatra Secuiului with beautiful
  views onto rustic Romanian farmland, a lily pond, and the ruins of Trascău Fortress.
  <br><br>
  The venue, the food, and the accommodations will be traditionally Romanian. The wedding guest list, however, reflects 
  our time living abroad, and the amazing people we met along the way. We cannot wait for you to bring your own language and traditions with you, and help
  us celebrate our own multicultural union. 
  <br><br>
  The ceremony will be conducted in both English and Romanian"
