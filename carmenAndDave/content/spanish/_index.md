  title: "Nuestra Historia"
  description: "A Romanian and an American walk into a bar..."
  content: "Carmen and Dave were actually set up on a blind date by a mutual friend, Emma, whom she knew from when she 
    lived in Berlin. Carmen had invited Emma
    to a weekend brunch to catch up, as it had been a while since they had seen each other. Emma, however, had already 
    let Dave know she had a cute, single, Romanian friend, and asked if he'd like to meet her. Once Dave agreed, Emma made the excuse 
    that she had already made plans to hang out with Dave that day, and asked if he could come as well to the brunch.<br><br>
    Dave, to prepare, invited the best 
    winglady he knew to hype him up, his sister Shelley. Shelley was ready with all of her best anecdotes where Dave would sound
    like the hero, and would temporarily avoid the embarrassing ones which are usually in the rotation. 
    There was only one problem - Shelley was wearing her wedding band that day, and Carmen thought they were both married, 
    and didn't think anything of it. Thankfully though, after a bit of hasty explanation from Emma later, the ruse worked!
    <br><br> While Carmen is still annoyed that she 
    was set up on a brunch she had scheduled herself, she and Dave have been together since, and now live happily together in Berlin with their two pets, Luna and Mario."

  title: "THE WEDDING"
  content: "The wedding will be held at Conacul Secuiesc located in rural Transylvania. The venue is in the shadow of the Piatra Secuiului with beautiful
  views onto rustic Romanian farmland, a lily pond, and the ruins of Trascău Fortress.
  <br><br>
  The venue, the food, and the accommodations will be traditionally Romanian. The wedding guest list, however, reflects 
  our time living abroad, and the amazing people we met along the way. We cannot wait for you all to join us, and help
  us celebrate our own multicultural union. 
  <br><br>
  The ceremony and events will be conducted in both English and Romanian to the best of our abilities... Don't worry though -  
  there will be plenty of țuică, which brings fluency in every language after enough shots."
