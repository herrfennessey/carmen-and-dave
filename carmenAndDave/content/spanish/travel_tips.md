### Corona Information


### Visas

Romania is not in the Schengen travel zone, so if you have a non EU passport, you will go through passport control. Most 
travelers will not need a visa. You can check whether or not you need a visa by going here
([http://evisa.mae.ro/](http://evisa.mae.ro/)) by clicking "Get Informed" on the top left. The type of visa 
you'll be applying for is "Tourism (marked C/TU)"

### Getting to and from the venue

For people who are staying at the venue, or nearby, we plan on shuttling people from the airport with more details to come.
<br><br>
For people who don't mind driving themselves, or want the flexibility, there are many rental car companies available 
from the airport if you'd like to drive yourself to the venue. Booking in advance is always better, because there are a few 
major festivals that happen in Cluj in the summer which might affect rental car availability. 

### Driving In Romania

Driving in Romania can be a little chaotic, and is about on par with in Italy. Public transit such as trains and subways 
are not well developed, and biking can be hazardous given how fast people drive. The only way to really get from city to city, 
especially rural destinations is via car. 
<br><br>
In big cities, parking can be difficult, although spots are quite plentiful in the countryside.  
<br>
<b>Romania has a legal blood alcohol level level of 0.0 - meaning if you plan on driving, do not drink.</b>

### Cell Phones

Romania is in the EU, so all EU based phone plans will have full service and data upon landing. If your phone plan doesn't allow 
international travel, or it's prohibitively expensive, you can buy a prepaid SIM card at the Cluj Napoca Airport at the Relay
store for about 6-10 euros if your phone is unlocked. The Orange and Vodafone network hae the strongest coverage around Romania.
<br><br>
All around Cluj, you should have full LTE, however the coverage is a little spotty at the venue (EDGE/3G), so if you're 
using your phone for google maps, we would recommend downloading the maps offline.  

### Emergency Numbers

<b>112</b> - Police / Fire / Ambulance


### Currency

Romania uses the Lei, not the Euro. It is about 4 Lei to a US Dollar, and 5 Lei to a Euro.
The ATM's in Romania typically charge quite a hefty fee in addition to whatever currency exchange fees are applied, so we 
would recommend exchanging currency at major banks in Cluj, or the money exchangers (might not speak English) if you would like to have cash with you.<br><br>
Nearly every store in Cluj Napoca, gas stations, and supermarkets accept credit card, even American ones, although we would
recommend bringing a card with a chip on it. Everything at the venue is paid for, but if you plan on traveling or sightseeing afterwards, 
especially to rural areas, cash could be useful.  

### Tipping

All of the venue staff will be fully paid and tipped, but if you would like, you can tip them in USD, EUR, or Lei.<br><br>In general in Romania, 
in restaurants and bars, you typically tip anywhere from 5% to 10%, usually the higher the bill, the smaller the tip percentage.
