  title: "Our Story"
  description: "A Romanian and an American walk into a bar..."
  content: "Carmen and Dave's first date was actually a blind setup by a mutual friend of both of theirs, Emma.
    <br><br>Carmen invited Emma to a weekend brunch to catch up, as it had been a while since they had seen each other.
    Unbeknownst to her, however, Emma had already secretly been communicating with
    Dave, letting him know she had a cute, single, Romanian friend, and asked if he'd like to meet her. Once Dave (very quickly) agreed, Emma made the excuse 
    to Carmen that she unfortunately had already made plans to hang out with Dave on the day of the brunch, and asked if he could come as well.<br><br>
    Dave, to prepare, invited the best 
    winglady he knew to hype him up, his sister Shelley. Shelley was prepared with all of her best personal anecdotes where Dave would sound
    like the hero, and would temporarily skip the embarrassing ones in her rotation to give him the best shot possible. The
    brunch went well, but there there was only one problem - Shelley was wearing her wedding band.
    While Dave did check all of Carmen's wishlist boxes of blond, tall, and blue eyes, she thought Dave and Shelley were married, 
    so she was much more focused on her pancakes than anything else. 
    Thankfully though, after a bit of hasty explanation from Emma later, the ruse worked! 
    <br><br> While Carmen is still annoyed that she 
    was set up on a brunch she had scheduled herself, she and Dave have been together since, and now live happily together in Berlin with their two pets, Luna and Mario."

  title: "THE WEDDING"
  content: "The wedding will be held at Conacul Secuiesc located in rural Transylvania. The venue is in the shadow of the Piatra Secuiului with beautiful
  views onto rustic Romanian farmland, a lily pond, and the ruins of Trascău Fortress.
  <br><br>
  The venue, the food, and the accommodations will be traditionally Romanian. The wedding guest list, however, reflects 
  our time living abroad, and the amazing people we met along the way. We cannot wait for you all to join us, and help
  us celebrate our own multicultural union. 
  <br><br>
  The ceremony and events will be conducted in both English and Romanian to the best of our abilities... Don't worry though -  
  there will be plenty of țuică, which brings fluency in every language after enough shots."
